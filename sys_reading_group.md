## Systems Seminar at University of Science and Technology of China (SYS-USTC)

The seminar provides an opportunity for students, researchers and faculty to discuss and keep abreast of current research in software systems. The high-level goals of the seminar are to help its participants keep abreast of important work in systems research, and to learn by example "how to do high quality systems research."

### Administrivia

The meeting is held at 11:00am (sharp) every Wednesday in Room xxx in NHPCC at Hefei

### Discussion Format

The primary focus of the discussion will be understanding what the paper says. With that in mind, the discussion leads should focus on clearly identifying
 - what is the problem being solved?
 - what are the challenges? what makes the problem difficult?
 - what are the key insights/techniques/lessons used to address those challenges? (i.e., how does it work)

We will also discuss other points, but we will try to keep these points as secondary concerns as much as possible
 - does it work? (i.e., evaluate the evaluation)
 - why does the problem matter? i.e., why should we (not) read the paper?
 - other points that arise

### Presentation/slide format

Consider structuring the presentation around the key discussion points. When guiding the discussion, the goal should be to guide the rest of the group through the discussion points above (roughly in order).

One slide template can be found at: xxx

### Paper selection

Discussion leads should propose a paper and justify why we should discuss the paper.

The current suggestion is papers covering system topics and published at top system conferences such as OSDI, SOSP, ASPLOS, SIGMOD, VLDB, ATC, EuroSys, NSDI, etc inÂ the recent 3 years. Please send your choices to chengli7@ustc.edu.cn to get approval.
