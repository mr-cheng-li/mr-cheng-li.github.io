## Welcome to Cheng Li's Website

I am an associate professor at the School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, and the director of the Information Computing Platform of the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center. My scientific interests are mainly in parallel and distributed intelligent computing and storage systems, with a data-centric perspective, to understand the mechanism of full-cycle data organization, storage, reading, writing, transmission and other factors affecting the computational efficiency during intelligent computing processes such as large models, and to propose new system architectures and design ideas.

Before joining USTC, I was an associated researcher with my PhD supervisor [Rodrigo Rodrigues](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/) at [INESC-ID, Portugal](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/), and a senior member of technical staff at [Oracle Labs Swiss](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=94065:23:2478385225960::NO::P23_LOCATION_ID:69). 

In 2016, I obtained my PhD degree from the Dependable Systems Group at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Sytems (MPI-SWS)](www.mpi-sws.org) and [Saarland University](http://www.cs.uni-saarland.de/) in Germany. Before studying at MPI-SWS, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Nankai University](http://nankai.en.school.cucas.cn/) in 2009.
