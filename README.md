## Welcome to Cheng Li's Website

I am pre-tenured research professor at the Department of Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and a member of the Advanced Data Systems Lab ([ADSL](http://adsl.ustc.edu.cn/)). My research interests lie in various topics related to computer systems such as operating systems, distributed systems, databases and etc, particularly in improving performance, consistency, fault tolerance, and availability of the above mentioned systems.

Prior to joining USTC, I was an associated researcher with my PhD supervisor [Rodrigo Rodrigues](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/) at [INESC-ID, Portugal](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/), and a senior member of technical staff at [Oracle Labs Swiss](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=94065:23:2478385225960::NO::P23_LOCATION_ID:69). 

In 2016, I obtained my PhD degree from the Dependable Systems Group at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Sytems (MPI-SWS)](www.mpi-sws.org) and [Saarland University](http://www.cs.uni-saarland.de/) in Germany. Before studying at MPI-SWS, I obtained my bachelor degree from [Nankai University](http://nankai.en.school.cucas.cn/) in 2009.

### News
- [Apr-19-2018] Our paper "Fine-grained Consistency for Geo-Replicated Systems" has been accepted by USENIX ATC 2018.
- [Apr-19-2018] Our paper "ElasticBF: Fine-grained and Elastic Bloom Filter Towards Efficient Read for LSM-tree-based KV Stores" has been accepted by HotStorage 2018.
- [Sep-05-2017] Congrats to Youxu on his research abstract accepted by [the Student Research Competition at SOSP 2017](https://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp17/src.html). In this project, we explore data correlations between files to seek opportunities for prefetching metadata of correlated files, in order to scale distributed file systems.
