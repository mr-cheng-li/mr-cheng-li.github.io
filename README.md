## Welcome to Cheng Li's Website

Most recently, I have joined the Department of Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) as a research professor. My research interests lie in various topics related to computer systems such as operating systems, distributed systems, databases and etc, particularly in improving performance, consistency, fault tolerance, and availability of the above mentioned systems.

Prior to joining USTC, I was an associated researcher with my PhD supervisor [Rodrigo Rodrigues](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/) at [INESC-ID, Portugal](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/), and a senior member of technical staff at [Oracle Labs Swiss](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=94065:23:2478385225960::NO::P23_LOCATION_ID:69). 

In 2016, I obtained my PhD degree from the Dependable Systems Group at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Sytems (MPI-SWS)](www.mpi-sws.org) and [Saarland University](http://www.cs.uni-saarland.de/) in Germany. Before studying at MPI-SWS, I obtained my bachelor degree from [Nankai University](http://nankai.en.school.cucas.cn/) in 2009.
